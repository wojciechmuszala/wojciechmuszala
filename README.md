## Hello folks! I'm Wojciech! 👋
🙋🏼‍♂️ I'm a passionate web developer specializing in frontend development.<br>
🎓 I hold a degree in [Automation and Robotics](https://weaii.po.edu.pl/automatic-control-and-robotics/?lang=en) from Opole University of Technology.<br>
🤖 After a few years of working as a robotics specialist, I switched to web development, which I have been doing since 2022.<br>
💼 I work in the e-commerce industry, primarily on platforms like [AtomStore](https://www.atomstore.pl/) (RWD & PWA) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).<br>
📚 Currently, I'm honing my skills in Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. Additionally, I'm enhancing my proficiency in English through [Preply](https://preply.com/).<br>
🚀 In the future, I aim to develop my own headless frontend based on Shopware [Composable Frontends](https://frontends.shopware.com/), leveraging technologies such as Vue3, Vite, Nuxt3, and unocss/Tailwind CSS.

## Current Project
🧑🏼‍💻 Outside of work, I'm actively developing a project called [🍊 HappyBelly](https://github.com/wojciechmuszala/vue-happy-belly) using Vue.js and styling it with Tailwind CSS. This app is a recipe repository with a weekly meal planner. You can track the progress of the project and learn more about it by clicking on its name!
